### Interactive Autodidactic School (IAS) algorithm
#### a Simple Python Implementation of IAS optimization algorithm

IAS is a population-based algorithm on the basis of the interactions between students
in an autodidactic school with the goal of increasing their knowledge through a combination
of self-teaching/self-learning, interactive discussion, criticism, and the competition.

### Dependencies

### About code
This simple code is based on the paper *Interactive autodidactic school: A new metaheuristic optimization
algorithm for solving mathematical and structural design optimization problems*, recently published
in *Cumputers & Structures*, Proposed by M. Jahangiri, M. A. Hadianfard, M. A. Najafgholipour, M. Jahangiri and M. R. Gerami.
